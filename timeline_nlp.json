Andrew Booth asked if the Rockefeller Foundation would fund a computer for London University. Weaver said that the Rockefeller Foundation could not fund a computer for mathematical calculations but that he had begun to think about using a computer to carry out natural language translation and that the Foundation probably could fund a computer for research in that area.</p><p>Thus Birkbeck University of London became for the next fifteen years a leading centre for natural language research.

The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another.
